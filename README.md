MVC4 - TodoMVC

A simple template for building backbone marionette applications
from a Visual Studio/NuGet package environment.

Template makes use of the following js libraries:
*Backbone
*Marionette
*Require
*Twitter Bootstrap
*Underscore

The default application loads the TodoMVC example with a 
restructured router. This approach is intended to provide ample
division in code structure for larger applications 
thru the addition of page layouts.
